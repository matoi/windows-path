# windows-path
Teach EMACS about Windows style path

This package lets you use windows-style filenames like "c:/path/file" or
"c:\path\file" in cygwin Emacs, or Emacs runing on WSL (Windows Subsystem for
Linux).  There is a cygwin-mount.el let you use Unix style path in native
Windows Emacs.  This package is a opposite of it.
